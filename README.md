# Olympic Games Medal Tracker

## Project Summary

This application is a Python-based Olympic Games medal tracker that fetches and processes data related to the 2024 Olympic Games. The application allows users to:

- Display the top 20 countries by gold medal and total medal counts.
- Visualize medal data using bar charts.
- Provide medal counts for specific countries based on user input.
- Show country flags alongside their medal counts.

## Features

- **Country Flags Display**: Displays the flag of the country next to its medal counts.
- **Medal Winners Lookup**: Allows users to look up medal winners for a specific country.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/olympic-medal-tracker.git
   cd olympic-medal-tracker
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Fetching and Displaying Medal Data

To fetch and display the top 20 countries by all medal counts, run:

```sh
python -m app.visualize_allmedals
```

To fetch and display the top 20 countries by gold medal counts only, run:

```sh
python -m app.visualize_gold
```

To input country name and receive medal data output, run:

```sh
python -m app.main
```

This will prompt you to enter a country name, and it will display the medal counts along with the flag for that country.

### Example

```
Enter the country name: United States
Flag: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
Gold Medals: 30
Silver Medals: 25
Bronze Medals: 20
Total: 75
```
